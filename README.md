## Description
A Node.js Readme Creator is a tool that generates a README file for a project using user input gathered through the terminal. It typically uses the inquirer.js library to prompt the user for information such as project name, description, installation instructions, usage, and licensing. The tool then formats this information in Markdown language to create a README file that can be easily read and understood by others. The end result is a well-structured and informative README that helps users better understand the project and how to use it.
